My name is Tyler Nevell and I'm a Front-end Engineer who specializes in JavaScript and TypeScript frameworks. I apply my passion for web development towards creating innovative experiences without relying on bulky libraries. I specialize in building efficient and fast web applications that look gorgeous and go above and beyond expectations. With every professional outlet, I seek the opportunity to surround myself with motivated, smart, creative people I can endlessly learn from while working on interesting and challenging engineering problems. To be an engineer is to be a lifelong student.
